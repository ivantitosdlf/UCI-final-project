# Heart Disease Risk Predictor

This project implements a neural network model to predict the risk of heart disease based on clinical data. It includes model training with PyTorch and an interactive web interface created with Streamlit to facilitate prediction and interpretation using SHAP explanations.

## ðŸš€ Execution

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/heart-disease-predictor.git
cd heart-disease-predictor

2. Execute interface.py:

To use the interface, execute: ```streamlit run interface.py --server.runOnSave=false```

3. (optional) Run train.py to generate a new trained model.
